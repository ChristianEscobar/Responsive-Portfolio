				Hi, 

				Thanks for visiting my page!  My name is Christian Escobar and this page is my personal space to

				showcase various Web Development projects I will be working on in the coming weeks.  I have 10 years of

				experience working as a Software Developer and I am now in the process of catching up, you can call it

				upgrding myself, with web development technologies by learning the MERN stack and getting myself up to speed

				with CSS3 and HTML5.

			<p class="sectionText">
				I have learned the hard way, that in the technology field, if you don't keep constantly up-to-date with 

				the latest technologies, you will quickly fall behind and will be playing catch up.

				Learning is hard, but keep yourself motivated and on days where things seem bleak, remind yourself
			
				of how much you enjoy what you do and how much you want to keep growing!

				Motivation is key in this field.	

			</p>

			<p class="sectionText">
				Besides being passionate about expanding my coding skills, I enjoy learning new technologies, movies, 


				travelling and whenever I find the time, playing video games.
			</p>
